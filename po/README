Creating locale translations for searchmonkey is simple, and quick to do!

To create your own language, first run:
 make update-po

This will create "searchmonkey.pot" - the template for you to work with.
Rename this file to match your language locale, for example:
 mv searchmonkey.pot en_GB.po

See unix application locale for details of your current locale, and valid names for locales.

Using your favourite po file editor (e.g. Emacs), open up the file, and start modifying the strings to make sense in your language.

Using Emacs makes it simple to edit po files. Pressing enter on any string, will opens up a new window to type in the translation. [C-c C-c] saves the change. Pressing [V] at any time, will verify the file will compile without error. Remember to update the header and ChangeLog file to reflect your changes.

Once complete, add your po file name (e.g. en_GB), and any symbolic links, to ../configure.in under the heading. For example:
 ALL_LINGUAS="en_GB en_US"

To see your results in action, run:
 ./autogen.sh prefix=/usr
 make
 sudo make install
 searchmonkey

If your locale is set correctly, you should see a magical transformation!

Enjoy!
